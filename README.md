# balto_gui
An Interactive GUI for BALTO in a Jupyter notebook

This respository creates a GUI (graphical user interface) for the BALTO (Brokered Alignment of Long-Tail Observations) project. BALTO is funded by the NSF EarthCube program. The GUI aims to provide a simplified and customizable method for users to access data sets of interest on servers that support the OpenDAP data access protocol. This interactive GUI runs within a Jupyter notebook and uses the Python packages: <b>ipywidgets</b> (for widget controls), <b>ipyleaflet</b> (for interactive maps) and <b>pydap</b> (an OpenDAP client).

The Python source code to create the GUI and to process events is in a module called <b>balto_gui.py</b> that must be found in the same directory as this Jupyter notebook.  Python source code for visualization of downloaded data is given in a module called <b>balto_plot.py</b>.

This GUI consists of mulitiple panels, and supports both a <b>tab-style</b> and an <b>accordion-style</b>, which allows you to switch between GUI panels without scrolling in the notebook.

You can run the notebook in a browser window without installing anything on your computer, using something called Binder. Look for the Binder icon below and a link labeled "Launch Binder".  This sets up a server in the cloud that has all the required dependencies and lets you run the notebook on that server.

To run this Jupyter notebook without Binder, it is recommended to install Python 3.7 from an Anaconda distribution and to then create a conda environment called balto. Simple instructions for how to create a conda environment and install the software are given in Appendix 1 of version 2 (v2) of the notebook.
